## Diary for the Project 

### October 1, 2020

I cloned the repository and added my diary. I discussed with the other members about the resources we can use for scraping data from wikipedia articles and found methods to detect links on the wikipedia page. With the info provided in these links, we hope we get a good start to the scraping process.
